# &lt;input&gt; tags without &lt;form&gt; tags

Back in the old days (TM) input fields would disappear if they weren't 
surrounded by &lt;form&gt; tags, so I have been paying special attention to their 
nesting ever since. Apparently, that bug has been fixed in the last 20 years 
and the HTML standard also alllows it. But It's still good form ðŸ˜‹ to nest them 
properly.
