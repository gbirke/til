# Bold and italic text in HTML5
In HTML5 the `&lt;b&gt;` and `&lt;i&gt;` tags aquired semnatic menaing beyond formatting.

Use `&lt;b&gt;` when you want the text to have a different style without contextual importance, but use `&lt;strong&gt;` when you want the text to have extra importance from a content or SEO perspective.

Use `&lt;i&gt;` to offset the mood of text, but use `&lt;em&gt;` to make text emphatic.
